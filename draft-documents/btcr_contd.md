# BTCR Goddammit

Authors: Kim Hamilton Duffy, Francesco Micheli, Anthony Ronning

# Abstract

BTCR is an open source, self-sovereign DID method spec. As it is volunteer-fueled, it's a been a long slog, but we're getting there. Fortunately, BTCR has been selected as the issueer DID method for the DIF E2E scenario. We have a deadline of October to get that going.

This paper tracks the wrap up work for an MVP. It will mostly be code.

# Details

We'll continue to interate on the BTCR specification, libraries, and mobile tools
